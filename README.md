<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/t1gr3/setup-kali-i3)

This project is created to transform the Kali Linux interface using I3 and make my life easier, since I usually just stick to the terminal to do my tasks.

Here's why:
* I like the terminal better than having just a graphical environment.
* I find it has a clean look and feel and you only invoke what you need.
* Finally I like the way it looks :smile:

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
